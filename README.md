# WeHub-Code-challenge
This is a simple React app for WeHub's code challenge.
The project uses a test JavaScript file as a dataset containing information for 100 test users, including their names, last names, email addresses, and genders. The app features a table component with search, sort, filter, and pagination functions.

For the search function, there is an input element that allows users to search for names, last names, and email addresses. Additionally, there is a select element on the right side of the page that enables users to filter users by their genders. The table is paginated with 10 users per page and includes buttons at the bottom to navigate between pages. Users can also click on the table headers to sort users by different properties in ascending or descending order.
